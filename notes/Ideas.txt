Reserve R15 for the mask register. Simplifies code verification and allows easy resizing of address spaces. Actually it only makes expansion of address spaces easy. Reduction is still hard.

Zero SSE registers when context switching. Have syscalls that block use a calling convention which invalidates all SSE registers.
Alternatively just zero some registers, and store the rest (in the same fashion as the usermode calling convention).

Don't store temporary variables on the call stack. Only use the user stack. Still use the call stack for push/pops of registers.
This simplifies verification alot.
Reserve RBX for the stack and replace all RSP references with RBX. (Might also make frame pointers work).
